-HOW TO PLAY-
-------------
The objective of the game is to run the farthest possible without hitting any objects (including the walls!) You score is based on the amount of coins you collect and the distance you travel. If you hit any object even once, the game ends and your score is calculated. As time goes on, your character's speed will increase, thus making the game more challening to continue.

CONTROLS
A key: Move left
D key: Move right
